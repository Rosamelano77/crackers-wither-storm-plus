# Suggestion guidelines


I don't mind taking suggestions, but, there are a few suggestions that people have mentioned I'd like to NOT have to continue denying.



## Story Mode suggestions

1. Tentacle attacks
-I don't plan on adding this. Its not like I could anyway. CWSPLUS is not about making it like Story Mode. 

2. More armors/Story Mode armors
-This is definitely out of the question. I have no intention on adding these as there is no point. There is also already tons of mods that add them.
